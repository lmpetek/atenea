<p>This is an example browser application for Google Calendar built using the GCal4Ruby Gem.</p>
<p>Enter your google calendar credentials below.  All information is stored by session only - no personal information is saved.  But obviously use a test account - this is not production code, so don't be suprised if something doesn't work like you expect it to.</p>
